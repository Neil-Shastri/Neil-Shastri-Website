I'm currently part of a technical team of consultants, from [CUBE Consulting](https://www.cubeconsulting.org/), developing a chatbot to analyze and deliver real-time data for a ticket brokerage company to improve customer engagement. We are leveraging Open AI's robust Assistants API for the framework, various ticketing APIs for data collection ([TicketMaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/), [StubHub](https://developer.stubhub.com/docs/overview/introduction/), etc), and [SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) to organize our backend database.
